# NLP-Hate-Speech-Detection
This project implements and evaluates a range of NLP models to perform binary classification on social media dataset, identifying comments as either "Hate Speech" or "Not Hate Speech." The primary goal is to compare the performance of classic machine learning techniques, traditional deep learning architectures, and modern Transformer-based models.
